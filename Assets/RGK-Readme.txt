Thank you for purchase of RGK.

I want to remind you something about vehicle controllers.There are different controllers that uses different inputs. 
As example for mobile you can use TouchDrive and for desktop you can use keyboard, gamepad and steering wheels.
In demos I enabled Desktop-Keyboard controllers as default but also added gamepad and mobile controllers too. 

I also provided a small script that switched this controllers on target platform. If you execute demos in mobile device, it will be switched automatically to mobile controller. 
And you dont have to make this control switch stuff for your development and mobile testing enviroment.

For mobile Controllers uses "Tilt Steering" as default that you have to turn your device left or right for steering.  If you want to use TouchDrive Wheel or Button you may want to check "Steering options" on RGKCar_C2_Mobile_Race 
component on RGKCar_Player cars prefab under _Racing Game Kit Demo/Racer Prefabs.
Also In RGKUI, this settings can be changed on Settings>Controller section without making any changes on prefabs.
